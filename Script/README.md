# AVISO converter

Double-click **Convert AVISO.cmd** on Windows. Select local source (Enter/1) or
the original official GitHub source (2). Python 3.10+ is required.

For unattended conversion:

```powershell
python Script/aviso_converter.py --local
python Script/aviso_converter.py --github
python Script/aviso_converter.py --source "path/to/folder-or.zip"
```

No arguments means local source; it never contacts GitHub. Explicit GitHub
selection downloads vaccfr/France-Ground-Layouts master and reports network
errors without silently using another source. Local input accepts a checkout,
an extracted outer repository folder, or a ZIP with GNG/ and Colours.sct.
The root source is preferred, then equivalent inputs under Input/.

GeoJSON/ is generated output. All products are validated before writing files.
An explicit source selection overwrites the existing GeoJSON output; official
source may contain different airports and geometry from a customized checkout.
No reports, summaries or cached downloads are generated.

Settings/ is the only place for editable vSMR customization: palettes,
backgrounds, groups, zoom levels and runway settings. Settings/Colours.sct
contains palette additions/overrides; conversion leaves root Colours.sct intact.
Colors in Settings take precedence over the selected pack's native definitions.

## Official sources are read-only

GNG/, KMZ/ and root Colours.sct are based on the official pack at
[vaccfr commit ed923f4](https://github.com/vaccfr/France-Ground-Layouts/commit/ed923f4b8ce11bbf1a0998597fd46595287b4d4c).
Conversion leaves all native source files unchanged. The LFPO background rectangle removal
was already merged upstream in PR #196. LFPO's Real background is configured
as #6C6A68 in Settings/Colours.sct.

Local source updates include LFBO gate categories and LFLL geometry/labels imported
from edited AVISO files. LFLL's KMZ retains its folder structure; new native color
names describe stand entry lines, surface markings and red taxiway markings.
Use local mode to retain these additions until they are available upstream.

LFBO's Real palette includes grass outlines. LFSB has an airport-specific Real
palette with grass outlines and no outlines on runways or hard surfaces.
These appearance settings do not modify native GNG/KMZ geometry or Dark/Light.

The converter reads all geometry and text exclusively from GNG. KMZ files
remain in the repository for the upstream workflow, but are neither required,
opened nor parsed. Folder inputs may omit KMZ entirely, and any KMZ entries in
ZIP inputs are ignored. Colours.sct and Settings supply rendering configuration.
Only airports with GNG records generate output.

KMZ archives were refreshed from official commit
[2f61d769](https://github.com/vaccfr/France-Ground-Layouts/commit/2f61d769d970e0574d37feccbbc51dc4b234cd8e)
and aligned to this checkout's GNG geometry. Native folders, styles and bundled
assets are retained. Point annotations/descriptions are removed and all labels
are disabled; text remains in GNG only. Airport KMZ geometry uses the exact
coordinates and native color tokens of current GNG, including its omissions.
LFLG, LFMU, LFPM and LFRK currently have text-only GNG, so their KMZ contain no
geometry. The regional coastline and reference template have no airport GNG
counterparts; their geometry is retained and checked for absence of text.

Feature IDs are deterministic output details and are never written back.
Optional group assignments use `file:<GNG filename without extension>` or an
exact feature ID. Groups with no assigned output feature are hidden; objects
available only in KMZ are not imported.
Conversion writes only GeoJSON; source/settings directories are rejected as
output destinations. All changes to appearance belong in Settings/.

## Verification

```powershell
python Script/verify_converter.py
python Script/verify_upstream.py
python Script/verify_kmz_geometry.py
```

The full regression check compares regenerated output with GeoJSON/, verifies
GNG geometry/text selection and KMZ isolation and checks that every source/settings file stays
byte-identical after conversion. The upstream check validates deterministic
conversion and independent color controls. Neither check edits the pack.
Palette regressions also check LFBO grass outlines, LFSB runway/apron outline
suppression and isolation of airport-specific Real color edits.

The KMZ check exports geometry to temporary GNG and parses it back. Coordinates,
native colors and geometry multiplicities must match exactly, without a spatial
tolerance. Polygon starting vertices/winding and line direction/packaging do
not affect the geometric comparison. The check does not reproduce comments,
whitespace, file splits or GNG text; it checks geometry, not byte-identical source
formatting. Repeated directed segments are exported into separate temporary
GNG files to preserve multiplicities despite native per-file deduplication.
All 64 KMZ are checked for
valid XML, complete style references and absence of text annotations.
